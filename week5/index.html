		<p><h2>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging </h2>
		A system error is when there is a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting
		<br>A programmer error is when the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic
		<br>A user error is when the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle
		<br>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error
		<br>A warning can occur if there is an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.
		<br>Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features
		<br>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code
		<br>Most modern browsers have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your code that will pause it at certain points
		<br>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function. This constructor function takes a parameter thatâ€™s used as the error message
		<br>You can throw your own exceptions using the throw statement. The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop
		<br>When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors. 
		<br>A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it should
