    <h2>Week 4</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Notes
		
		<p><h2>Chapter 8: Forms </h2>
		Forms are made up of a form element that contains form controls
		<br>A form object has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection of all the elements contained in the form
		<br>The form.submit() method will submit the form automatically
		<br>A form can be submitted manually by a button or input element with a type attribute of submit
		<br>Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that’s been entered
		<br>The focus event occurs when an element is focused on
		<br>The blur event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element
		<br>The change event occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it
		<br>input type='password' is used to enter passwords or secret information. The characters are concealed as they are entered so they’re unable to be read on the screen
		<br>Check boxes are created using input fields with type='checkbox'
		<br>Radio buttons are created using input fields with type='radio' 
		<br>Each radio button has a 'checked' property that returns the boolean values true and false , depending on if it has been selected or not
		<br>Hidden fields can be created using input fields with type='hidden'
		<br>A file input field can be created using input fields with type='file'
		<br>A textarea element is used to enter long pieces of text over multiple lines such as a comment or blog post
		<br>Form validation is the process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly
		</p>

		<p> <h2>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</h2>
		The keyword "this" is used to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function
		<br>The parentheses are not required when instantiating a new object using a constructor function
		<br>JavaScript contains a number of built-in constructor functions such as Object , Array , and Function that can be used to create objects, arrays and functions instead of literals
		<br>the names of constructor functions or class declarations are capitalized
		<br>All objects have a constructor property that returns the constructor function that created it
		<br>The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method.
		<br>All classes and constructor functions have a prototype property that returns an object
		<br>The prototype object is live, so if a new property or method is added to the prototype, any instances of its class will inherit the new properties and methods automatically
		<br>The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared
		<br>A golden rule to remember is:Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype
		<br>By default, an object’s methods are public in JavaScript.
		<br>When an object calls a method, the JavaScript engine will check to see if the object has that method. If it doesn’t, it will check if the object’s prototype has the method. If not, it will check whether the prototype’s prototype has it 
		<br>A class can inherit from another class using the extends keyword in a class declaration
		<br>Instead of using assignment, properties are added to an object using the Object.defineProperty() method
		<br>An object property descriptor can have get() and set() methods instead of a value attribute. All objects must have one or the other, they can't have both
		<br>Creating objects from objects will create a prototype chain
		<br>Every time a new object is created using the Object.create() method, the new object inherits all the properties and methods from the parent object, which becomes the new object’s prototype
		<br>A factory function is a function that can be used to return an object
		<br>If a method returns this , its methods can be chained together to form a sequence of method calls that are called one after the other
		<br>The bind() method is a method for all functions and is used to set the value of this in the function
		</p>

		<p> <h2>Chapter 15: Modern Javascript – Modular Javascript</h2>
		A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules
		<br>The code in a module should have a single purpose, and group together functions with distinct functionality
